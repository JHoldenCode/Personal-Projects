This program assumes that the shipwreck is somewhere in front and to the right of the rexrov. The rexrov then travels in a boustrephedon motion until it locates the ship 
with its sonar. It then goes through a series of steps to orient where it is in relation to the ship and finally travels to the start point for urban_cylinder_cleaning.
