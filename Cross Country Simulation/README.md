Allows the user to input a number of races to simulate, then the program simulates a dual cross country meet with seven athletes per team the specified number of times. 
After simulation, it informs the user of various statistics including: the chance of winning when a team has the first place finisher, the top two finishers, or the top
three finishers. It also keeps track of the number of perfect scores (15-50) (when one team's runners all finish before any of the other teams). It is important to note that
the finishing order of these races are completely random so it may not apply to an actual race when some runners are predicted to be faster than others. Some future plans for this
project may be to include a skill level for the runners to account for the differences in ability between individual athletes and also to include other teams in the simulation
to see how the statistics change with a greater number of athletes.
